# indexer_and_search

# What is it?
This is a demonstration of using the TF-IDF algorithm within Python for file indexing and searching, as well as Docker container API communication and delineation between a Bootstrap JS frontend and a Python Flask API backend. The environment uses two separate Docker containers for the search and indexer components.
