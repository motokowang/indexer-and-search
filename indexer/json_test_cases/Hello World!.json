{"title" : "Hello World!", "text" : "Your computer won't respond when you yell at it. Why not learn to talk to your computer in its own language  Whether you want to write games, start a business, or you're just curious, learning to program is a great place to start. Plus, programming is fun!    Hello World! provides a gentle but thorough introduction to the world of computer programming. It's written in language a 12-year-old can follow, but anyone who wants to learn how to program a computer can use it. Even adults. Written by Warren Sande and his son, Carter, and reviewed by professional educators, this book is kid-tested and parent-approved.    You don't need to know anything about programming to use the book. But you should know the basics of using a computer--e-mail, surfing the web, listening to music, and so forth. If you can start a program and save a file, you should have no trouble using this book."}
