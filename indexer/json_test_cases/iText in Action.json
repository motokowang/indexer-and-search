While at the entry level iText is easy to learn, developers find they soon need its more advanced features. Written by the master himself, iText in Action now offers an introduction and a practical guide to the subject--you will gain a sound understanding of the Portable Document Format and how to do interesting and useful things with PDF using iText.    iText in Action introduces iText and lowers the learning curve to its advanced features.
