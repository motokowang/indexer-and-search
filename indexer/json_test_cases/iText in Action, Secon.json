{"title" : "iText in Action, Second Edition", "text" : "Far from a static document presentation format, PDF supports many dynamic or interactive features. With iText, the leading tool creating and manipulating PDF programmatically, you can transform PDF documents into live, interactive applications quickly and easily. iText, a free, open source library for Java and .NET, was developed and maintained by Bruno Lowagie, the author of this book, with the help of many contributors.    iText in Action, Second Edition offers an introduction and a practical guide to iText and the internals of PDF. While at the entry level iText is easy to learn, there's an astonishing range of things you can do once you dive below the surface. This book lowers the learning curve and, though numerous innovative and practical examples, unlocks the secrets hidden in Adobe's PDF Reference. The examples are in Java but they can be easily adapted to .NET using one of iText's .NET ports: iTextSharp or iText.NET.    This totally revised new edition introduces the new functionality added to iText in recent releases, and it updates all examples from JDK 1.4 to Java 5. You'll learn how to use traditional and new form types in PDF, including full coverage of the AcroForm technology. You'll also explore the XML Forms Architecture (XFA) and learn how to fill static and dynamic XFA forms with iText. Along the way, you'll discover new techniques for linking documents, creating a PDF based on records in a database, and much more.    WHAT'S INSIDE        * Serve PDF to a browser      * Automate both static and dynamic XFA forms      * Generate dynamic PDF documents from XML files or databases      * Use PDF's many interactive features      * Add bookmarks, page numbers, watermarks, etc.      * Split, concatenate, and manipulate PDF pages      * Add digital signatures to a PDF file      * New hands-on, ready to use examples"}
