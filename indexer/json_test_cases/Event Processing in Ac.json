{"title" : "Event Processing in Action", "text" : "When you look carefully, you notice patterns connecting the events that occur in any system. Some events have obvious and immediate relationships. Other patterns are more complex or develop over a longer time. Event Processing is the ability to identify and react to events and event patterns as they occur.    Event Processing in Action is a ground-breaking book that introduces the major concepts of event driven architectures and shows you how to use, design, and build event processing systems and applications. The book looks at practical examples and provides an in-depth explanation of their architecture and implementation. Throughout the book, you'll follow a comprehensive use case that expert authors Opher Etzion and Peter Niblett construct step-by-step.    Complex Event Processing, or CEP, is an emerging discipline, as well as an emerging market, which in 2008 is estimated in  150M and is expected to cross the  1B mark in 2-3 years. According to analysts' surveys, many businesses are starting to investigate both technical and business value considerations of implementing event processing into their organizations.    Event Processing in Action will answer key questions like:        * What are event driven architectures and how do they fit enterprise applications       * What are the various uses of event processing       * What are its major concepts       * What is the life-cycle of event driven application, and how should building such an application be approached     As the story unfolds through the construction of an event-driven application, readers will see how a specification in a graphical notation grows into a working example. Programming examples will be based on a set of building blocks developed in the book; existing commercial products and open source alternatives will be surveyed.    This book is intended for software architects and developers who want to understand the principles behind the emerging discipline of event processing, and go deeper to the details."}
