{"title" : "Objective-C Fundamentals", "text" : "The iPhone is a sophisticated device, and mastering the Objective C language is the key to unlocking its awesome potential as a mobile computing platform. Objective C's concise, rich syntax and feature set, when matched with the iPhone SDK and the powerful XCode environment, offers a developers from any background a smooth transition into mobile app development for the iPhone.    Objective-C for the iPhone is a hands-on tutorial that leads you from your first line of Objective-C code through the process of building native apps for the iPhone using the latest version of the SDK. While the book assumes you know your way around an IDE, no previous experience with Objective-C, the iPhone SDK, or mobile computing is required.    You'll learn to avoid the most common pitfalls, while exploring the expressive Objective-C language through numerous example projects. Starting with the first chapter, you'll dive into iPhone development and the XCode IDE by developing a simple game that you can immediately run on your iPhone. You'll meet the Interface Builder and the debugger, while implementing the Model-View-Controller paradigm common to most iPhone applications.    WHAT'S INSIDE        * Gain a solid Objective-C foundation specific to iPhone development      * Master memory management      * Key Value Coding and Observing      * Exception handling      * Create custom classes, categories and protocols      * Practical examples work on an iPhone without modification    Each chapter introduces a new language feature or concept, and each concept is put into context, so you're empowered to apply it effectively. Each chapter ends with a practical example ready for you to deploy to your iPhone.    Along with the core Objective-C language, you'll discover the Foundation Framework classes, techniques such as Key Value Coding (KVC) and Key Value Observing (KVO), and more ways to enhance your productivity."}
