{"title" : "ASP.NET MVC in Action", "text" : "ASP.NET MVC implements the Model-View-Controller pattern on the ASP.NET runtime. It works well with open source projects like NHibernate, Castle, StructureMap, AutoMapper, and MvcContrib.    ASP.NET MVC in Action is a guide to pragmatic MVC-based web development. After a thorough overview, it dives into issues of architecture and maintainability. The book assumes basic knowledge of ASP.NET (v. 3.5) and expands your expertise. Some of the topics covered:        * How to effectively perform unit and full-system tests.      * How to implement dependency injection using StructureMap or Windsor.      * How to work with the domain and presentation models.      * How to work with persistence layers like NHibernate.    The book's many examples are in C#."}
