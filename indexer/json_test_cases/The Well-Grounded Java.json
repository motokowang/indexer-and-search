{"title" : "The Well-Grounded Java Developer", "text" : "The Java community has always been dynamic and fast-moving, with constant innovation on the core platform as well as a vibrant community ecosystem. New JVM-based languages like Groovy, Scala, and Clojure are redefining what it means to be a Java developer. The core Standard and Enterprise APIs now co-exist with a large and growing body of open source technologies. Multicore processors, concurrency, and massive data stores require new patterns and approaches to development. And with Java 7 due to release in 2011, there's still more to absorb.    The Well-Grounded Java Developer is a unique guide written for developers with a solid grasp of Java fundamentals. It provides a fresh, practical look at new Java 7 features along with the array of ancillary technologies that a working developer will use in building the next generation of business software.    The book starts with thorough coverage of new Java 7 features. You'll then explore a cross-section of emerging JVM-based languages, including Groovy, Scala, and Clojure. Along the way, you'll find dozens of valuable development techniques showcasing modern approaches to concurrency and performance."}
