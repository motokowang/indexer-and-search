It will help you learn EJB 3 and the JPA quickly and easily. This comprehensive, entirely new EJB 3 book starts with a tour of the EJB 3 landscape. It then moves quickly into core topics like building business logic with session and message-driven beans. You   ll find four full chapters on the JPA along with practical code samples, design patterns, performance tuning tips, and best practices for building and deploying scalable applications."}
