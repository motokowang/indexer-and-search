{"title" : "Arduino in Action", "text" : "Whether you want to build an autonomous robot, automate your home electronics, or just automatically tweet when the bread is ready, you can do it with Arduino. Arduino is an inexpensive, easy-to-use, open source hardware and software platform. It supports a mind-boggling array of sensors and components that you can use to build nearly anything you can imagine.

Arduino in Action is a hands-on guide to prototyping and building electronics using the Arduino platform. Suitable for beginners and advanced users, this easy to follow book begins with the basics and systematically guides you through projects ranging from your first blinking LED through connecting Arduino to devices like game controllers or your iPhone.

You'll start at the very beginning: unpacking your first Arduino board, connecting it to a PC, and using the programming environment to make something happen. You'll follow progressively more complex examples as you connect your Arduino to motors, LCD displays, Wi-Fi, GPS, and Bluetooth. You'll explore a variety of input output sensors, including ultrasound, infrared, and light, along with how to use them for tasks like robotic obstacle avoidance."}
