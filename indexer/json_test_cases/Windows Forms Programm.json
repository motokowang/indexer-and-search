{"title" : "Windows Forms Programming with C#", "text" : "In the .NET environment, GUI elements like menus, buttons, lists, trees--and of course the window itself--are created and deployed using the new Windows Forms framework. Windows Forms is an object-oriented set of classes that offers an effective, modern programming environment for rich Windows applications development.    Intended for beginner and intermediate programmers willing to get their hands dirty, this book teaches by example. Step-by-step instructions guide the reader through the entire Windows Forms namespace. Examples build around a common theme, collectively developing a real-world application. The book covers fundamentals like labels, menus, buttons, as well as advanced concepts like owner-drawn lists, explorer-style interfaces, customized data binding, and the integration of the Microsoft web browser control into a Windows program. Appendices include a 30-page reference to the C# language and a handy visual index of the Windows Forms classes."}
