{"title" : "Camel in Action", "text" : "Apache Camel is a Java-based toolkit that makes it easy to implement services based on standard enterprise integration patterns (EIP). Through a concise, but sophisticated domain specific language (DSL), you can build integration logic in lego style. The Camel DSL is implemented in a range of standard programming languages such as Java, XML, Scala, Groovy, Ruby, and Python.    Camel provides components for using these patterns via commonly used transports such as JMS, HTTP, REST, File/FTP, JPA, SMTP, and more than 50 others. No transport  Camel provides a flexible pluggable architecture to build your own components. Or you can let Camel adapt to your existing libraries without the need to change anything.    Camel in Action is for developers working with integration of any kind. This highly practical book introduces Camel and shows examples of how to use it with the 45+ supported enterprise integration patterns. Written by the people who wrote the Camel code, it's up to date and distills details and insights that only people deeply involved with Camel could provide.    Camel is designed to run in any existing environment without imposing restrictions. This allows you to get started with Camel very easily and reuse existing infrastructure and platforms. Camel can run in many forms such as standalone, web or Spring application, JBI, OSGi, Java EE, in the cloud, and so on. The book includes a technical reference explaining how to use Camel with many platforms."}
