EJB is experiencing the mixture of practical success and controversy that accompanies a new and quickly-changing framework. Bitter EJB takes the swirling EJB controversies head-on. It offers a practical approach to design: how to become a better programmer by studying problems and solutions to the most important problems surrounding the technology.    The flip side of design patterns, antipatterns, are a fun and interesting way to take EJB expertise to the next level. The book covers many different aspects of EJB, from transactions to persistence to messaging, as well as performance and testing.    Bitter EJB will teach programmers to do the following:    Identify EJB persistence strategies  Choose Entity bean alternatives  Use EJB message driven beans  Know when to apply or avoid stateful session beans  Create efficient build strategies with XDoclet, Ant and JUnit  Automate performance tuning"}
