{"title" : "Dynamic WAP Application Development", "text" : "This comprehensive guide provides developers with the necessary skills to develop WAP applications and build dynamic Web sites for wireless use. Dynamic WAP Application Development first introduces the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) and offers an in-depth explanation of the prominent wireless languages.    The authors begin with HDML (Handheld Device Markup Language), the first wireless language and one still supported by many Internet-enabled phones in the United States. They next cover WML (Wireless Markup Language), the XML-based successor to HDML that is supported by most phones worldwide. The third language described is WMLScript, the client-side scripting language of the wireless world that enables the developer to include procedure logic within their WML markup. In addition to hands-on practice with each of these languages, the book examines the issues involved in wireless application design and in converting HDML documents into WML.    The book also provides an overview of Microsoft Active Server Pages (ASP) and Java Servlets, and guides developers through the process of creating dynamic WAP applications using these server-side technologies.    Application design specific to the small display and limited memory capacity of wireless phones is also covered. Advanced topics include security, performance, and the intricacies of WAP gateways. The book also includes robust case studies that put WAP concepts into practice.    This book is geared for developers who are called upon to extend existing Web services to wireless phone subscribers and for those who need to understand the resources involved in the development and deployment of WAP applications."}
