{"title" : "Grails in Action", "text" : "Web apps shouldn't be hard to build, right  The developers of Grails agree. This hyper-productive open-source web framework lets you "code by convention", leaving you to focus on what makes your app special. Through its use of Groovy, it gives you a powerful, Java-like language and full access to all Java libraries. And you can adapt your app's behavior at runtime without a server restart.    Grails in Action is a comprehensive guide to the Grails framework. First, the basics: the domain model, controllers, views, and services. Then, the fun! Dive into a Twitter-style app with features like AJAX/JSON, animation, search, wizards   even messaging and Jabber integration. Along the way, you'll discover loads of great plugins that'll make your app shine. Learn to integrate with existing Java systems using Spring and Hibernate. You'll need basic familiarity with Java and the web. Prior experience with Groovy is not necessary."}
