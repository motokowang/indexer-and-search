{"title" : "Entity Framework 4 in Action", "text" : "To be successful, any significant application has to manage the flow of data effectively. Microsoft   s approach to data has taken another major step forward with the new Entity Framework for .NET. The Entity Framework starts with ideas from Object Relational Management (ORM) tools like NHibernate that help bridge the mismatch between relational databases (like SQL Server) and object oriented languages (like C# and VB.NET). But it also blends in the established ADO.NET model and recent language-based innovations of LINQ to create a powerful new data management paradigm.    Microsoft Entity Framework in Action introduces the Entity Framework to developers working in .NET who already have some knowledge of ADO.NET. The book begins with a review of the core ideas behind the ORM model and shows how Entity Framework offers a smooth transition from a traditional ADO.NET approach. By presenting numerous small examples and a couple larger case studies, the book unfolds the Entity Framework story in clear, easy-to-follow detail. The infrastructure and inner workings will be highlighted only when there   s the need to understand a particular feature."}
