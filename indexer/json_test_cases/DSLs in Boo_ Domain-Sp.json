{"title" : "DSLs in Boo: Domain-Specific Languages in .NET", "text" : "A general-purpose language like C# is designed to handle all programming tasks. By contrast, the structure and syntax of a Domain-Specific Language are designed to match a particular applications area. A DSL is designed for readability and easy programming of repeating problems. Using the innovative Boo language, it's a breeze to create a DSL for your application domain that works on .NET and does not sacrifice performance.    DSLs in Boo shows you how to design, extend, and evolve DSLs for .NET by focusing on approaches and patterns. You learn to define an app in terms that match the domain, and to use Boo to build DSLs that generate efficient executables. And you won't deal with the awkward XML-laden syntax many DSLs require. The book concentrates on writing internal (textual) DSLs that allow easy extensibility of the application and framework. And if you don't know Boo, don't worry   you'll learn right here all the techniques you need.    WHAT'S INSIDE:        * Introduction to DSLs, including common patterns      * A fast-paced Boo tutorial      * Dozens of practical examples and tips      * An entertaining, easy-to-follow style"}
