{"title" : "Java Reflection in Action", "text" : "You are a Java developer. You are asked to add a simple feature to your application. But "simple" can be deceiving: you have to make many changes, in locations which can be difficult to find.    If this sounds familiar, you want to know about Java reflection. With reflection, you can work smarter by designing flexible applications to which you can easily add likely new requirements. Then, with a few code changes in easy-to-find places, you've got the job done. Reflection adds a new dimension to your programming skills. It will boost your effectiveness.    Java Reflection in Action starts from the basics. It gradually builds a complete understanding, adding as it goes reflective concepts illustrated with many small examples that are useful in real applications.    In a subplot, the book follows a programmer, George, as he tackles common but difficult tasks. In each case, George finds flexible, reflective solutions that replace the usual hard-coded ones. The power of reflection becomes clear through his story."}
