{"title" : "Spring Integration in Action", "text" : "Spring Integration is a Java-based enterprise integration framework. It acts as a Message Bus embedded within a Spring Application Context and thus provides a lightweight alternative to more traditional ESBs. By merging the "Enterprise Integration Patterns" outlined by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf (Addison Wesley, 2003) with the programming model of the Spring framework, Spring Integration is remarkably powerful and yet easy to use. It builds upon other members of the Spring family, such as Spring Web Services and Spring Security, and it integrates with Spring Dynamic Modules for OSGiTM, Spring Batch, and the Spring/BlazeDS project.    Spring Integration in Action is a hands-on guide to Spring-based messaging and integration. After addressing the core messaging patterns, such as those used in transformation and routing, the book turns to the adapters that enable integration with external systems. Readers will explore real-world enterprise integration scenarios using JMS, Web Services, file systems, and email. They will also learn about Spring Integration's support for working with XML. The book concludes with a practical guide to advanced topics such as concurrency, performance, system-management, and monitoring.    WHAT'S INSIDE        * Written by the Spring Integration core team      * Covers Spring Integration version 2.0 and Spring Framework version 3.0      * Introduces messaging patterns as implemented in Spring Integration      * Provides realistic working examples    The book assumes a working knowledge of Java. Prior experience with Spring and enterprise integration patterns is helpful but not required."}
