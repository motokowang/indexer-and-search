{"title" : "Microsoft.NET for Programmers", "text" : "Written for intermediate and advanced programmers, this book builds on your existing knowledge to teach you exactly what you need to know to develop .NET applications.    Packed full of practical examples, the book presents a case study which takes you through the design of an application "engine" and its implementation as a .NET assembly. You'll reuse the engine to create different versions of the application using Windows Forms, Remoting, Web Services, Windows Services, COM, MSMQ, ASP.NET, ADO.NET, and the Mobile Internet Toolkit. You'll also learn about fundamental .NET concepts such as types and assemblies and develop a simple language compiler which can emit a .NET executable.    Also included is an appendix containing a comprehensive introduction to the C# programming language."}
