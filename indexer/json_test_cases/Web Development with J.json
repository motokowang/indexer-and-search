{"title" : "Web Development with JavaServer Pages, Second Edition", "text" : "The second edition of the bestselling Web Development with JavaServer Pages updates and expands the original. In the entirely rewritten first part of the book the authors provide a gentle introduction to the important technologies on which JSP depends. The book then launches into its updated coverage of the JSP 1.2 and Servlet 2.3 standards. New chapters on servlet filters, tag-library validation, and non-HTML content are filled with fresh examples.    This second edition shares the strengths of the first, based on the authors' substantial experience with real-world development. The book covers the complete feature set of JSP 1.2, and both the advantages and the "gotchas" associated with those features. Its depth of coverage has been an important contributor to this book's success.    You'll learn how to use databases in web applications, how to separate the look of a web page from its underlying business logic, and even how to design elegant and scalable application architectures. You can learn from and modify the many examples to get up to speed quickly. And you will develop a deep understanding of JSP technology."}
