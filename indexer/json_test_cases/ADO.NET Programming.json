{"title" : "ADO.NET Programming", "text" : "ADO.NET, Microsoft's new data access technology, provides all the standard data access capabilities you would expect. It also solves the unique problems associated with disconnected database access needed for robust n-tier and web applications.    ADO.NET Programming covers database programming in .NET and illustrates important steps with nice examples. It shows you how you can achieve effortless separation of data presentation from data access; how to easily go from relational data to XML, and back; how to bind data directly to the Web and Windows Controls; how to write generic access code that talks to multiple databases without change; and much more. Along the way, it illuminates with well-focused examples, points out the "gotchas," and teaches best practices."}
