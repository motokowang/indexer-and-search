{"title" : "SharePoint 2010 Site Owner's Manual", "text" : "For every SharePoint 2010 developer who spends the day buried in Visual Studio cranking out code, there are dozens of other SharePoint site owners who want to share information, create content portals, and add features to existing SharePoint sites. If you're one of these SharePoint administrators, this is the book for you. Chock-full of great ideas and scenarios you'll relate to immediately, this book will teach you the amazing things you can do with SharePoint 2010 without writing any code   or calling in the developers.    SharePoint 2010 Site Owner's Manual starts by assuming you already have SharePoint installed on your system and are looking for ways to solve the problems you face every day in your organization. You'll learn to determine what type of SharePoint installation you have   Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS), Windows SharePoint Services (WSS), the "Fabulous 40" templates   and what features are at your disposal. Once you know the lay of the land, you'll discover what you can do yourself, when you need to call in some help, and when you should leave it to the developers.    This book teaches you by putting your hands on working SharePoint examples. You'll see seven common SharePoint-driven sites that lay out the features and approaches you'll need for most typical applications. The examples range from a simple document-sharing portal, to a SharePoint-hosted blog, to a project management site complete with a calendar, discussion forums, and an interactive task list."}
