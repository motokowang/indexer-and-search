{"title" : "JUnit in Action", "text" : "Developers in the know are switching to a new testing strategy - unit testing - which interleaves coding and testing in an integrated way. This has proven to be a powerful combination that results in better designed software with fewer defects and faster delivery cycles.    JUnit in Action shows you how to benefit from this strategy using the popular open source testing framework, JUnit. It's a no fluff discussion of unit testing techniques and best practices. It gives examples of tough situations such as how to unit test EJBs, database applications, JSPs and Taglibs. It discusses unit testing of J2EE applications, and shows how to test in automated builds."}
