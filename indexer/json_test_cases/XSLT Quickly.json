{"title" : "XSLT Quickly", "text" : "XSLT Quickly is, quite obviously, for anyone who needs to learn XSLT quickly. This book has two main goals: to familiarize the reader with the portions of XSLT that he/she will use eighty per cent of the time, and to provide a "cookbook" approach to learning additional techniques as they are needed.    Part One is a step-by-step tutorial that brings the reader up to speed on the basic concepts and document manipulation techniques necessary for the most common XSLT tasks. More importantly, it represents the foundation on which the understanding of everything in Part Two is built.    Part Two is a cookbook--a task-oriented user's guide to various issues one may meet in tackling XSLT. This portion of the book is organized by the goals of XSLT tasks (converting elements to attributes, reading in multiple documents at once, etc.). This makes it far easier for readers who don't already know XSLT to quickly find the solutions to their stylesheet development problems.    XSLT Quickly also includes a glossary, a quick reference section for XSLT syntax, and a quick reference for using the popular XSLT processors."}
