{"title" : "SCBCD Exam Study Kit", "text" : "There is probably no Java certification more valuable to you than Sun Certified Business Component Developer CX-310-090. To pass you need a readable, no-nonsense book focused like a laser beam on the exam goals. SCBCD Exam Study Kit is that book.    The study kit makes sure you first understand all the concepts you need to know, large and small, and then covers every single exam topic. It provides more than 130 review questions with answers distributed over all chapters and an Exam's Eye View section at the end of each chapter on the important points to remember.    Although SCBCD Exam Study Kit has only one purpose - to help you get certified - you will find yourself returning to it as a reference after passing the exam. A demo on how to install the necessary software, write a simple bean, deploy the bean, and execute it, as well as a free SCBCD exam simulator can be downloaded from the publisher's website."}
